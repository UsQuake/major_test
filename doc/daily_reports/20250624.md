## Tasks
  
  - I studied that contributors of SPOON represent a model with abstract classes(virtual method) like below.
  - ```Java
    public abstract class AbstractProcessor<E extends CtElement> implements Processor<E> {
    Factory factory;
    Set<Class<? extends CtElement>> processedElementTypes = new HashSet();
    ...etc virtual methods
    }
    ```
  - With semantic of a model in SPOON, We can simply mutate an AST and propogate to other ASTs like below.
  - And below is not a good example...to show use-case of fixed MODEL in mutation(analysis). 
  - ```Java
    public class BinOpMutator extends AbstractProcessor<CtElement>{
    @Override
    public boolean isToBeProcessed(CtElement candidate) {
        return candidate instanceof CtBinaryOperator;
    }

    @Override
    public void process(CtElement candidate) {
            if (!(candidate instanceof CtBinaryOperator)) {
              System.out.println("It's not binary operator!");
              return;
            }
            CtBinaryOperator op = (CtBinaryOperator)candidate;
            op.setKind(BinaryOperatorKind.MINUS);
        }
    }
    ```

  - I checked out both fixed, buggy version of a commons-lang bug(Defects4j bug ID:1, LANG-747)
    * I found that *revision.id.(fixed,buggy)* is an exact commit hash of an origin repository within Defects4j
    * and they made an commit independently from the repository of Defects4j.
