# Weekly report
## TODO
  - Should track changed part of soure codes while bug-induction -> bug-detection.
  - Should try mutating target projects.
    
## Review
### Setup & Requirements

  - Java(17 ~ 18) <- With Java 11, 24 Error occured.
  - Maven(We can still use *SBT - Scala*, *Gradle - Kotlin, Java* Because JVM packaging system is integrated with URL(HTTP) of JAR).
  - [SPOON *version* 11.2.1(Below is described environment under Maven build-packaging system - POM.xml)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/fr.inria.gforge.spoon/spoon-core)
  - defects4j ver.2(ver. >3 is not working with InduceBenchmark)
  - MinWeng-CS/InduceBenchmark
  - Git > 1

## Explanation
### SPOON
  - Just setup environment & follow-up tutorial of SPOON. 
  - I made a main logic of Mutation of target java code with JavaSpoon.
### Defects4j
  - I checked out both fixed, buggy version of a commons-lang bug(Defects4j bug ID:1, LANG-747)
    * I found that *revision.id.(fixed,buggy)* is an exact commit hash of an origin repository within Defects4j
    * and they made an commit independently from the repository of Defects4j.
  
  - I reviewed [a paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-016-9470-4) with defects4j
    * I studied bux-fixing sequence(induce -> detect -> fix)
### InduceBenchmak
  - I found a setup of defect4j with git which works with *MinWeng-CS*.
    * I found that commit hash of *MinWeng-CS* is synchronized with 2nd version of defects4j.
    * Recently, defects4j started to use 3rd version of defetcs4j as default version of the repository.
 - Made a fork of a [defects4j](https://github.com/UsQuake/defects4j/tree/bug_induction) to track easily to future works.
