## Setup & Requirement

  - defects4j ver.2(ver. >3 is not working with MinWeng-CS )
  - MinWeng-CS
  - Git > 1

## Review
  
  - I reviewed [a paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-016-9470-4) with defects4j
    
    * I studied bux-fixing sequence(induce -> detect -> fix)
  
  - I found a setup of defect4j with git which works with *MinWeng-CS*.
   
    * I found that commit hash of *MinWeng-CS* is synchronized with 2nd version of defects4j.
    * Recently, defects4j started to use 3rd version of defetcs4j as default version of the repository.
